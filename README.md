**Pragmatic Type-Level Design** is a deep book that explores practical concepts of type-level design in various statically typed FP languages, especially Haskell, F#, OCaml, Scala.

Unlike most resources focussing on mathematical underpinnings of type-level programming, this book's primary emphasis lies in pragmatism: it explores the practical application of these concepts in actual programming scenarios. It formulates best practices, examines how types influence application design and architecture, and outlines principles to navigate the challenges of managing the inherent complexity in type-level code.

Haskell is a model language, but the book will contain the Rosetta Stone part that mirrors the approaches from Haskell to other languages.

**Pragmatic Type-Level Design** best works in pair with **Functional Design and Architecture** ([First Edition, self-published](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-design-and-architecture), [Second Edition, Manning Publications](https://leanpub.com/functional-design-and-architecture)), another my fundamental book about software desigin in functional languages.

Both FDaA and PTLD provide a consistent, pragmatic and structured set of knowledge never seen before in the functional world.

Buy both and learn a lot of great ideas presented in academism-free mature style. You'll likely won't see anything better than my books anywhere else in the field.
