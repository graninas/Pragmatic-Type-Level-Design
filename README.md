**Pragmatic type level design** is a book about practical ideas expressed with the help of the rich type system of Haskell. In contrast with all other materials about types in Haskell, the main focus of this book is not the type system itself, and not the related math. The main focus is the applicability of those concepts in the real world: best practices, use cases, design patterns, approaches, principles, advantages and disadvantages of different solutions.
