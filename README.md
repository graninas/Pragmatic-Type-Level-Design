# Pragmatic-Type-Level-Design

Code and materials for my book [Pragmatic Type Level Design](https://leanpub.com/pragmatic-type-level-design).


**Pragmatic Type-Level Design** is a book that delves into practical concepts harnessed by the robust type system of Haskell. Unlike most resources centered around Haskell's type system or its mathematical underpinnings, this book's primary emphasis lies in pragmatism: it explores the practical application of these concepts in actual programming scenarios. It delves into best practices, examines how types influence application design and architecture, and outlines principles to navigate the challenges of managing the inherent complexity in type-level code.
