**Pragmatic Type-Level Design** is a book that delves into practical concepts of type-level design in various statically typed FP languages, especially Haskell, F#, OCaml, Scala.

Unlike most resources focussing on mathematical underpinnings of type-level programming, this book's primary emphasis lies in pragmatism: it explores the practical application of these concepts in actual programming scenarios. It delves into best practices, examines how types influence application design and architecture, and outlines principles to navigate the challenges of managing the inherent complexity in type-level code.

Haskell is a model language, but the book will contain the Rosetta Stone part that mirrors the approaches from Haskell to other languages.

See also: [Functional Design and Architecture](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-design-and-architecture). FDaA is my deep book on high-level software design with statically typed functional languages. Both FDaA and PTLD provide a consistent, pragmatic and structured set of knowledge never seen before in the functional world.
